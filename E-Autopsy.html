The incisors are of humanoid appearance, but due to the dehydrated nature of dead flesh, the gum line indicates that there may be additional teeth hidden above these exposed incisors that are markedly longer in size and sharper in shape. Next to the incisors in both the top and bottom jaw reside two large fang-like cuspids, for a total amount of four. The remaining teeth, of which there are twelve in number, are wide tri-pointed molars of incredible sharpness. The next thing of particular note was the creature’s strange tongue. The length of this apparatus, unable to fit flatly in the oral cavity, folds onto itself to be stored neatly in the back of the mouth. In texture, it is found to be of semi-firm tissue with small ridges on both sides. Interestingly, the tongue appears to consist of spongy erectile tissue. It is unknown why the creature possesses such an organ, vaguely similar to the proboscis of certain insects, when considering the nature of the teeth. Further dissection needed.">
